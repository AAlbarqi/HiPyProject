# HiPy learning resources

### Created by Sam Ball and Sam Cassidy

### Welcome to the HiPy resource Github folder! Here you can find all of our resources, as well as some bonus stuff if you look hard enough! If you've found this page by accident and don't know where to start, head over to the "Getting Started" folder and start in the first folder, and work your way through numerically. Or not. I'm not your boss.
