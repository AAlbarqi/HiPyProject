There is, in general, no expectation that the elements of a tuple be data of the same type. An inventory of products may, for example, be a list of two-element tuples each containing an item (string) and its price (float or integer).\n",

    "Lists are the workhorse structure of Python. Their use case should be pretty intuitive -- you want to make a list of things. While both are order sequentially, they differ from tuples in several important ways. The first is that there is the expectation that the items in the list are all of the same kind. To consider a real world example, imagine you are looking at your receipt after buying groceries. It is perfectly sensible that our receipt is a list of triples <code>(item, quantity, price)</code>. However, we would find it incongruous and possibly incomprehensible if items, quantities, and prices were given as separate items in the list! Second, lists are highly dynamic objects. Their entries can be modified, and they can be extended or reduced on the fly. We say they are \"mutable\". Lists have many functions built into them to facilitate these mutations, and we'll showcase some of the more common ones here. Firstly though, we note that creating a list is very similar to creating a tuple. We have 3 methods for doing it, very similar to the tuple, but using square brackets:"

This sounds remeniscent of variables, with which we are already very familiar. The difference is that variables are something created by the programmer to appear in the source code. The keys of a dictionary can be created by the program itself as it is running. Suppose your program is running and creating lots of new data, and you want to assign names to the different bits of data you are creating as the program is running. The program cannot create a new variable. But it can put the data into a dictionary and give it a key!"
