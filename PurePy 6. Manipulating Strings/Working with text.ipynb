    "String manipulation is widely regarded as one of Python's strong points. These segments of text contain many rich features, and it is straightforward in Python to pull strings apart and re-combine them in interesting ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with strings is an important skill in Python. For one, reading data into a program will often take the form of a file containing text, and so we must be proficient in extracting the bits we're interested in. Moreover, we are humans. We do not want the computer to merely spit out a list of numbers after performing a calculation; we want our outputs presented in a way that we can actually read.\n",

    "## Slicing and dicing\n",

    "To get a \"slice\" of a string is similar to getting an item from a list (in fact we can also get slices of lists by the same syntax). However, we specify a start and end index, rather than just an index:"
